## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Fake SMS Provider

This repository includes a small fake SMS provider for local testing. It stores messages in the application cache and can simulate callbacks to an external endpoint.

Environment
- Add the following to your `.env` (or use `.env.example`):

```
FAKE_SMS_CALLBACK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/receive-sms
FAKE_SMS_MAX_MESSAGES=500
```

Routes
- POST /api/get-message  - simulate receiving an SMS (expects JSON { number, text })
- POST /api/send-message - simulate provider sending an SMS (expects JSON { text, number? })
- GET  /api/cache-watch  - returns { messages: [...] }

Examples
- Receive a message (user -> provider):

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/get-message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"number\":\"233555000111\",\"text\":\"Hello\"}"
```

- Send a provider message (provider -> callback):

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/send-message -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"number\":\"233555000111\",\"text\":\"Reply from provider\"}"
```

Web UI
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to see a minimal dashboard and forms to interact with the API.
